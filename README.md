# The Dive Den

### Group Project 1

In this this first group project the we decided to make an app that allowed scuba divers of all experience levels to find, rate, and explore new and old dive spots from around the state of Florida. 

### Why a Diving app?

While researching for fun and exciting places to visit in Florida we noticed how hard it was to find anything on cool places to Scuba Dive so that's when we set out on making an app that not only shows you were the local dive spots are but also showing off the local communities that explore them!

### What does the app do?

1. This Scuba Diving app gives people who are curious about diving or are in search of new places to explore an outlet and resource for their next (or first) exciting underwater adventure!

2. We have Integrated google maps with each diving location around the state of Florida!

3. Each location has it's own 5 day weather forecast so each diver can plan accordingly

4. There is a cool community of divers out there so we decided to show them all off having fun with a live picture feed of all the neat dive spots from around the state!

5. Each dive spot has its own story so from our web page you can access more information about the site just by clicking on the dive spot's link

6. Need a Mask? Maybe two? We got you covered with the ability to buy your scuba supplies right here online from our Scuba shop links below!

7. Feeling lost or looking for a particular dive site? Just click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner and type in the name of that dive site everyone's been talking about!

8. (an Idea? You guys wanna add a link to some blogs?) There are tons of stories and blogs out there on the different dive sites across the state so if you're feeling in the mood to read about one before you gear up say no more! Click one of these links and jump on in!

9. (another Idea? You guys wanna add a link to a donation page?) Lastly as dive enthusiasts the rush of exploring a new cave, sunken ship or a beautiful coral reef is exciting none of it would be possible without the ecosystem that surrounds it. That's why we are proud to support the Florida Wildlife Federation where our community of divers can donate directly to the foundations that make our exciting adventures possible and to preserve them for our future fellow divers to come.

### Bottom Line

This app was made for the dive enthusiast in all of us and is a place new and experienced divers alike can go to find the inspiration needed for that next big adventure waiting just around the corner. This app is the first of its kind and we hope to see some familiar and new faces in the photo reel!
